For readers who are not familiar with 2-dimensional condensed matter systems, the dimensionality here refers to the number of dimensions in the momentum space of the system (or k-space). An ubiquitous example of 2-dimensional system is graphene, there are many more exciting systems, even systems that are few-layers thick. These few layer thick materials are still 2-D systems as their k-space has only 2 dimensions even though in real space they have 3 axis with n-number of layers giving them thickness.</p></div>

LiCoO2 is a layered system with alternating layers of Li and CoO2 sheets stacked in A-B-C order. Electronic structure of this system is a simple semiconductor (as expected) with Li giving its one electron off to the CoO2 layer. CoO2 has the Co in an octahedral environment attached to O, which brings in the crystal field splitting to have t2g and eg groups split. Thus with the 5 electrons it shares with oxygen and the gained 6th electron from Li layers, Co has d-6 configuration with the t2g bands filled which makes it a simple gaped system.&nbsp;<div><br></div></div>

Quasiparticle self consistent GW theory is a parameter free theory derived from the famous Hedin’s equation. This is a theory added upon the GW approximation in the Hedin’s equation. Hedin’s equation is a self-consistent set of equations that can be used to get the eigenvalues of a set of interacting particles given the eigenvalues of non-interacting particles. In GW approximation we limit the number of Feynman diagrams coming into the calculation of self energy to first order when expanded in perturbation of W (the screened Coulomb interaction). This can also be thought of as setting the Gamma* diagrams in the <a href="licoo2.html#image1-a">Figure 17</a> to 0 while converting the bare coulomb interaction to screened/dressed interaction or setting Gamma in the first feynman diagram to 1.

Calculating the QSGW bands with non interacting Hamiltonian as LDA and LDA+U ideally should give us the same self energy (as the theory is parameter free and should not be influensed, atleast ideally, by the starting point) and thus the same final calculated bands, but interestingly, for monolayer CoO2 starting from LDA and LDA+U gives metallic and insulating band structures respectively as shown. Which would indicate the system has two set of solutions (or at least local minimas) for its self energy. Further analysis is required to understand which exactly is the lowest energy minimum in self energy. Since this involves many body theory, the definition and calculation of total energy of systems is not exactly trivial and often times RPA (random phase approximation) level energies are used. One needs to think a bit more as RPA level diagrams shown in <a href="licoo2.html#image1-c">figure</a> might not just be sufficient for the resulting two phase separation in self energy space.</div>

When Li is the farthest, instead of getting back the LDA like band structure of monolayer CoO2 shown in <a href="licoo2.html#image1-8">figure</a>, we see that the the free electron like band that is responsible for the 2DEG is forming more “rigidly”. This tells us that these bands actually belong to pure Li forming states with each other in the neighboring cell. The power of theorists is that, we can test this hypothesis even though thats totally an unphysical system.&nbsp;<div></div></div>

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><div>Figure above shows the band structure of elemental Li in the same unit cell. It is basically LiCoO2 with the CoO2 layer removed and now we clearly see the 2DEG state that is nothing but Li-Li tight binding interaction with both Li-s and Li-p orbital states forming bonding wave functions as shown in the color picture which has the band structure projected onto the respective orbitals. Again, the plot of electron density of this shows 2DEG forming. One thing to note is that it is the Li-s states (red ones in the figure) is the one thats mostly occupied (bellow fermi level) even in the elemental Li. And also that the s-p hybrid states are not that high in energy and this might be closely related to the fact that we can see the 2DEG in our state has hints of pz orbital character in it from the electron density pictures in the earlier figures. &nbsp;</div></div>

The figure above shows the comparison of pure elemental Li and LiCoO2. As seen the occupied in elemental Li and LiCoO2 are actually different, in LiCoO2, its the Li-p states that’s producing the 2DEG and lies near the fermi. This result still needs to be understood better but is none the less one clue taking us closer to the big answer.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div></div>
